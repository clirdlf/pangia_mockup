      All around the city subway ridership plummeted during the first two weeks
      of the Covid-19 outbreak. On average, stations saw a decrease of more than
      50% in entries and exits between March 6th and March 20th, 2020. But as
      this map shows, the drop in ridership did not happen uniformly throughout
      the city.

      Income inequality certainly played a role in the uneven distribution of
      subway usage. By overlaying median household income and change in subway
      entries it becomes clear that those stations with less change are located
      in low-income areas, specially in the Bronx and outer Queens and Brooklyn.

      Elmhurst Hospital Center has been identified as one of the hospitals most
      overwhelmed by the number of patients with COVID-19 it has received.
      Located in a low-middle-income area of the city, with a median household
      income of around $50,000, the hospital serves one of the most diverse and
      immigrant dense areas of the city. The three subway stations around the
      hospital have all seen relatively small change in their usage compare to
      the rest of the city.

      The South Bronx, perennially marred in social injustice, has also been
      hard hit during the current COVID-19 outbreak. The area's three main
      neighborhoods, Mott Haven, Melrose and Port Morris are mostly home to
      low-income families that have been forced to continue going to work,
      risking their health and that of their loved ones. Similarly to Jackson
      Heights in Queens, the areas subway stations have seen a smaller decrease
      in use than the rest of the city. Median household income in this area
      oscillates between $15,000 and $30,000.

This example shows a storytelling template to show how maps could be used to do engaging story telling. This is based on data [MTA Turnstyle data](https://pointsunknown.nyc/web%20mapping/mapbox/2020/03/25/10_WebmappingTurnstileData.html). 

This demonstration uses [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/), as well as [Intersection Observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intersection-observer) and [Scrollama](https://github.com/russellsamora/scrollama) as the main JavaScript libraries.

It also embeds media examples with local (e.g. images), video (e.g. YouTube), sound (e.g. SoundCloud) and uses spatial layers in `geojson` format.
