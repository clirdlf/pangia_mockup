To deliver on this commitment, the 2018-2020 NAP proposes two steps: 1) holding 10 open science engagement sessions with federal scientists and invited Canadians across the country, and; 2) publishing a report on identified user needs. Between March 12, 2019 and February 26, 2021, ECCC has investigated the open science needs of federal open science users through direct engagements with the public as well as with federal scientists. This report summarizes ECCC&rsquo;s findings and fulfills Milestone 5.4 of the 2018-2020 NAP.</p>
