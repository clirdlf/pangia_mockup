title: COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries
licence: other-license-specified
type: dataset
description: 'The following dataset provides state-aggregated data for hospital utilization
  <b>in a timeseries format</b> dating back to January 1, 2020. These are derived
  from reports with facility-level granularity across three main sources: (1) HHS
  TeleTracking, (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial
  health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities and (3) National Healthcare
  Safety Network (before July 15).


  The file will be updated regularly and provides the latest values reported by each
  facility within the last four days for all time. This allows for a more comprehensive
  picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented,
  even if they miss a single day of reporting.


  No statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account
  for missing data.


  The below table displays one value for each field (i.e., column). Sometimes, reports
  for a given facility will be provided to more than one reporting source: HHS TeleTracking,
  NHSN, and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate
  reports, prioritization is applied to the numbers for each facility.
